This extension adds a configurable captcha to the backend login after a give amount of failed login tries.

#Important!

Since TYPO3 Version 11 does have an internal [rate limit system](https://docs.typo3.org/c/typo3/cms-core/main/en-us/Changelog/11.3/Feature-93825-RateLimitingForFailedLogins.html), we have decided to abandom the development of this extension for TYPO3 Version 11 and beyond. 


## 1. Features

- Configurable captcha for backend login

## 2. Usage

### 1) Installation

#### Composer installations

For TYPO3 v10
```
composer require mfc/mfc-belogin-captcha ^5.0.0
```


For TYPO3 v9 use the 4.x tags and branch
```
composer require mfc/mfc-belogin-captcha ^4.1.0
```

### 3) Configure the extension

The extensions needs to be configured in the admin tools extensions.

| Name | Description | Default |
| ---- | ----------- | --------|
| failedTries | Failed logins before captcha gets rendered | 5 |
| api_server | reCAPTCHA API-server address | https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js |
| verify_server | reCAPTCHA VERIFY-server address | https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify |
| public_key | reCAPTCHA public key ||
| private_key | reCAPTCHA private key ||
| lang | reCAPTCHA language ||

If no public_key and private_key are set, the configuration of the extension "recaptcha" will be used automatically. When there is no public_key and private_key configured in both extensions, no captcha will be displayed.
